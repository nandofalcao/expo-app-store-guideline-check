## The Three Main Categories

### 1. Data Used to Track You

or shared with data brokers.

**Declare here if:**

**Requires:** App Tracking Transparency (ATT) for iOS 14.5+

### 2. Data Linked to You
Data collected and **associated with the user's identity** (account, name, email, etc.)

**Declare here if:**
- The app has a login/account system
- Data can be traced back to the user

### 3. Data Not Linked to You
Data collected but **not associated** with the user's identity (anonymous or pseudo-anonymized).

**Declare here if:**
- Crash logs without identifying information
- Analytics with anonymous IDs
- Technical diagnostics

## Important Tips

1. **Privacy Labels ≠ Privacy Policy** — Labels are a visual summary, not the complete document
2. **Must be consistent with Privacy Policy** — data declared in one must be in the other
3. **Update with each version** that introduces new data collection
4. **Apple verifies** — incorrect Privacy Labels are grounds for rejection
5. **"Not Collected" is not an option** — if not collected, simply don't declare that category
6. **Tracking requires ATT** — if declaring "Used to Track You", must have ATT implemented

## After Filling Out

- [ ] Review against Privacy Policy for consistency
- [ ] Verify that ATT is implemented if declared "Used to Track You"
- [ ] Save screenshot of settings for future reference
- [ ] Review whenever a new SDK or feature is added to the app
